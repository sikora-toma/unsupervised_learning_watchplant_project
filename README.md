# unsupervised_learning_watchplant_project
Application of unsupervised learning methods to data collected from plants with the goal of obtaining high level information, such as air quality or temperature.


## File structure
- code: contains the notebook with the python code used to handle the data, train the models, and inspect the results.
- figures: contains the graphs that put the results of the training into perspective.
- resources: contains the literature used to learn about the topic at hand.
